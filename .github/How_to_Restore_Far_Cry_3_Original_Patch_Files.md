The original patch files are patch.dat and patch.fat, which are located in the data\_win32 folder of the game installation directory. These files contain important data and resources for the game to run properly. If these files are corrupted or modified by some mods, the game may not work as intended or crash.
 
To restore the original patch files, you need to download them from a reliable source. One possible source is the YouTube video by noel jose[^1^], which provides a link to download the files from MEGA. Another possible source is the Mod DB website[^2^], which hosts various patches and mods for Far Cry 3. You can find the official patches for the game under the Files section of the website.
 
Once you have downloaded the original patch files, you need to replace them in the data\_win32 folder of your game installation directory. Make sure to backup your current patch files before doing so, in case you want to revert back to them later. You may also need to disable or uninstall any mods that conflict with the original patch files.
 
After replacing the patch files, you should be able to run Far Cry 3 without any glitches or compatibility issues. Enjoy the game!
  
If you want to enhance your Far Cry 3 experience with some mods, you can find many options on the Mod DB website. Some of the most popular and recommended mods are:
 
- **Far Cry 3 Redux**: This mod is an immersive overhaul of the game, with a focus on balance instead of brutal challenge. It changes many aspects of the game, such as weapons, enemies, skills, crafting, loot, environment, and more. It also removes some annoying features, such as enemy detection icons, minimap, and quick time events. The mod aims to make the game more realistic and enjoyable.
- **Far Cry 3 2020**: This modpack includes a more modern UI, QoL changes, an updated design for Jason, and slight performance enhancements. It also includes Reborn Reshade, which improves the graphics and lighting of the game. This modpack is compatible with Redux and other mods.
- **Far Cry 3 Cartoon ReShade preset**: This preset makes Far Cry 3 look like Borderlands, with a cel-shaded style and vibrant colors. It adds a comic book feel to the game and makes it more fun and unique.

To install these mods, you need to follow the instructions provided by the mod authors on their respective pages. Some mods may require you to use the Far Cry 3 Mod Tools, which are updated tools for editing and creating mods for the game. You can also use these tools to make your own mods if you are feeling creative.
 
With these mods, you can enjoy Far Cry 3 in a new and exciting way. Have fun!
